# Operon + Project Pages — full runbook

## Current starter kit (10-09-2026)

For a new vault matching the current laboratory desktop, use the repository's
`obsidian-setup/README.md` and `obsidian-setup/install.py` first.
The Atlas Obsidian page links to the repository setup. It pins Operon **3.0.1**, Border
1.13.6, fourteen enabled plugins, Personal and Reading boards, startup workspace,
and hash-checked display patches. Two installed but disabled plugins are optional.
The installer only creates a new vault and never merges over an existing one.

For an existing vault, inspect its actual plugin versions, back up configuration,
and compare against a separate starter vault with the target app closed. Preserve
all task IDs, statuses, custom presets, notes and access settings. Do not run the
legacy 2.2.1 patcher or enable the archive job as part of this starter setup.

The kit also includes a deterministic read-only Hermes projection into each
existing project's `Knowledge/Hermes/`. It preserves the source task ID/status;
a system scheduler refreshes it every 60 seconds. It is not an Operon board or an
LLM heartbeat. SSH access and project routing are configured by each recipient.
See `obsidian-setup/README.md` for the supported `kanban.db` profile and checks.

The instructions below remain a **legacy 2.2.1 reference**, not the current recipe.

Detailed reference for the `operon-obsidian-setup` skill. Reproduces the lab's Operon
task-manager configuration and project-page conventions in an Obsidian vault. Target
Operon version **2.2.1**.

Placeholders: `<VAULT>` = absolute vault path, `<OWNER>` = task owner name/handle.
All config changes apply **only after a full Obsidian restart** (Operon reads settings at startup;
editing its files live does not auto-apply — or use `operon:reload-settings-from-storage` +
`operon:rebuild-index`).

Bundled files (relative to the skill folder): `scripts/operon_configure.py`,
`scripts/operon_patches.py`, `scripts/operon_daily_archive.py`, `assets/project-link-badges.css`,
`assets/table-preset.json`, `assets/Task.template.md`, `assets/Project-Page.template.md`,
`assets/Project-Literature.template.md`, `assets/com.OWNER.operon-archive.plist.template`.

---

## 1. Data model

- All tasks are Operon tasks (`operonId` + `status: Project.<Label>` + `priority: A/B/C` + `dateDue`…).
- **A project is a flat `project` tag, not a hierarchy.** Work tasks do NOT use `parentTask`; project
  membership is the custom `project` list field (several values allowed).
- **Project root tasks** `[PROJECT] <name>.md` are file-task "entities" kept in `Operon/Projects/`, which
  is excluded from the index, so they never show up in Table/Kanban/Calendar/Finder.

## 2. Taxonomy

**Status pipeline** (single, named `Project`):
`Brainstorming · Planned · InProgress · Finished · Paused · Dropped`
Stored as `Project.Planned`, `Project.Finished`, … The pipeline-name prefix cannot be removed natively
(display patch #1/#2 in §6 strips it for display only).

**Custom field** `project` (`taxonomy.keyMappings.custom` in `data.json`): type `list`, icon `folders`.
Value format: file-task `project: [MultiAgents, Zero-order]`; inline `{{project:: MultiAgents, Zero-order}}`.

The configurator (`scripts/operon_configure.py`) writes both.

## 3. Folder structure

| Folder | Role | In Operon index? |
|---|---|---|
| `Papers/`, `Projects/` (user projects) | work tasks (file + inline) | yes |
| `Operon/Projects/` | project roots `[PROJECT] <name>.md` | **no** (excluded) |
| `Operon/Archives/` | archive (parked / finished) | **no** (excluded) |
| `Operon/Templates/` | file-task templates | templates, not tasks |
| `Operon/Tasks/` | new file-tasks from Task Creator | yes |

Create: `VAULT/Operon/{Projects,Archives,Templates,Tasks}` and `VAULT/_System/Templates`.

## 4. Plugin config (`operon_configure.py`)

Idempotent; backs up `data.json` before writing. Run:
```bash
python3 scripts/operon_configure.py "<VAULT>" "<OWNER>"
```
It sets:
- `taxonomy.pipelines` — the single `Project` pipeline (six statuses above).
- `taxonomy.keyMappings.custom` — appends the `project` list field if absent.
- `settings.excludedFolders` — `["Operon/Archives", "Operon/Projects"]`.
- `ui.taskCreationProfile` — `fileTasksFolder: Operon/Tasks`, `fileTaskTemplateFolder: Operon/Templates`,
  `taskCreatorDefaultFileTemplateId: folder-file-task-template:Operon/Templates/Task.md`.
- `automation.taskAutomationPolicy.fileTaskAutoArchiveEnabled: false` (external cron does day-boundary archiving).
- `views.filters.fs_mytasks` — `assignees anyContains <OWNER>` (the "my tasks" filter used by the table preset).

Applies cleanly to a fresh Operon install; on an existing install it MERGES (replaces the status pipeline,
appends the field/filter only if missing). Restart Obsidian afterwards.

## 5. Table preset "tasks"

Copy `assets/table-preset.json` → `VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/operon/data/table-presets/table-preset-my-first-table.json`
(back up any existing one). Key points: `name: "tasks"`, `filterSetId: "fs_mytasks"` (only OWNER's tasks),
`project` column added at the end of the visible columns. Make sure the sibling `index.json` lists the preset id.

## 6. Code patches (`operon_patches.py`) — optional, display-only

Single idempotent script. Backup of the original: `main.js.prepatch` in the plugin dir. Patches change only
display/suggestions; stored data is untouched. Bound to Operon **2.2.1**: on another version the anchors won't
match and the script aborts without a partial write.

```bash
python3 scripts/operon_patches.py "<VAULT>"
```

| # | Function | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `rre` | table status without the pipeline prefix (`Project.Finished` → `Finished`) |
| 2 | `Jn` | same for compact chips (Finder / overlays) |
| 3 | `e8` | `assignees` suggestions also sourced from `people/` cards (`имя` → `name` → basename) |
| 4 | `Xp` | **emoji as task icon**: a non-Lucide `taskIcon` (has chars outside `[a-z0-9-]`) is drawn as text |
| 5 | Task Creator toolbar | icon preview in the creator draws emoji |
| 6 | Task Editor swatch | icon preview in the editor draws emoji |
| 7 | icon picker source | the task-icon grid picker offers an emoji palette instead of Lucide (`_EMOJI` in the script) |
| 8 | icon picker cell | picker cells draw emoji as text |
| 9 | `vv` resolver | lets an emoji `taskIcon` pass through instead of being swapped for a Lucide fallback |

- ⚠️ **Any Operon update overwrites all patches** → re-run the script after each update.
- Emoji icon is set by value, not the picker: `taskIcon: 🤖` (frontmatter) or `{{taskIcon:: 🤖}}` (inline).
  Lucide names (`network`, `shield-alert`) still render as SVG.
- Patch #3 reads top-level cards in `people/` (frontmatter `имя:`/`name:`, else the filename). Add a
  collaborator by creating `VAULT/people/<name>.md`.
- The status patch does not affect Obsidian's native Properties panel (still raw `Project.Finished` there).
- The emoji set is edited in the `_EMOJI` list inside `operon_patches.py`.

## 7. Templates

### `Operon/Templates/Task.md` (from `assets/Task.template.md`, replace `<OWNER>`)
```markdown
---
assignees: [<OWNER>]
---
# {{taskDescription}}

## Описание


## Прогресс


## Результат
```
`assignees: [<OWNER>]` defaults new file-tasks to the owner (required for the "my tasks" filter).
Supported vars: `{{taskDescription}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{datetime}}`, `{{note}}`, `{{dateStarted}}`,
`{{dateScheduled}}`, `{{dateDue}}`. (Applies to file-tasks only; inline tasks are single lines.)

### Project page & literature templates
`assets/Project-Page.template.md` → `_System/Templates/Project Page.md`,
`assets/Project-Literature.template.md` → `_System/Templates/Project Literature.md`.
If the vault is not Russian, translate the section headers; keep the frontmatter schema.

## 8. Project-page convention

A project = folder `Papers/<project>/` (or `Projects/<project>/`) with:
- `<Project> (проект).md` — the project page (template above). Order: **links block → description →
  link to literature → Work history → Problems → Reports**.
- `<Project> — литература.md` — a MOC of the project's papers, linking into the global `Literature/`.
- `Reports/` — weekly reports. `Проблемы/` — problem / inconsistency notes.
- work/analysis notes live in the folder root, linked from Work history.

The page is a **prose note with tasks interleaved via Task Wikilink Overlay** (Operon v1.8+). A
`[[Task name]]` link to a file-task renders in Reading/Live Preview as an interactive task row (checkbox,
status, emoji icon, chips); the edit action opens the Task Editor with the full body
(Описание/Прогресс/Результат). Insert one via the command **"Operon: Add Task Wikilink Overlay"**
(Task Finder → pick or create → link inserted at the cursor). Tasks remain file-tasks in the project folder.

**Service-link badges** (`assets/project-link-badges.css` → `VAULT/.obsidian/snippets/`): a normal external
link to github/arxiv/huggingface/overleaf/wandb/google-docs auto-renders as a badge with that service's logo
(Reading/Live Preview). Add a new service with an `a.external-link[href*="domain"]` selector. Enable the
snippet in Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets.

## 9. Dashboard

Operon embeds **only Table and Filter** in a note (Kanban/Calendar are full panes). So the dashboard is an
embedded table plus a button row that opens the other surfaces. Create `VAULT/Dashboard.md`:

````markdown
---
type: dashboard
---
# Дашборд

```dataviewjs
const cmds = [
  ["📋 Kanban", "operon:open-kanban-view"],
  ["📅 Calendar", "operon:open-calendar-view"],
  ["🔍 Task Finder", "operon:open-task-finder"],
  ["📌 Pinned dock", "operon:toggle-pinned-dock"],
  ["♻️ Rebuild index", "operon:rebuild-index"],
];
const bar = dv.el("div", "", { cls: "operon-dash-bar" });
bar.style.cssText = "display:flex;gap:8px;flex-wrap:wrap;margin:.5em 0";
for (const [label, id] of cmds) {
  const b = bar.createEl("button", { text: label });
  b.style.cssText = "padding:4px 10px;border-radius:7px;cursor:pointer";
  b.onclick = () => app.commands.executeCommandById(id);
}
```

## Все задачи

```operon
presetId: "table-preset-my-first-table"
```
````

> Command ids may differ between Operon versions. If a button does nothing, open the command palette
> (⌘/Ctrl-P), type "Operon", and substitute the current `commandId` (inspect `app.commands.commands` in the
> developer console). Requires Dataview with `enableDataviewJs`.

## 10. Auto-archive (optional, macOS — launchd)

Operon can archive only with a fixed delay ≤ 1 hour; "at the new day boundary" is not native. The external
cron (`scripts/operon_daily_archive.py`) moves file-tasks with status `Project.Finished`/`Project.Cancelled`
whose completion date is **strictly before today** into `Operon/Archives`. Inline checkboxes and tasks without
`operonId` are never touched. Test first:
```bash
python3 scripts/operon_daily_archive.py --vault "<VAULT>" --dry-run
```
Install the script (e.g. `~/.local/bin/`), then render `assets/com.OWNER.operon-archive.plist.template`
(substitute `<OWNER>`, `<SCRIPT_PATH>`, `<VAULT>`) into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.<OWNER>.operon-archive.plist`
and load it:
```bash
launchctl unload "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.<OWNER>.operon-archive.plist" 2>/dev/null
launchctl load  "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.<OWNER>.operon-archive.plist"
```
Runs daily at 00:05 **and** at each login (`RunAtLoad` catches up if the Mac slept at 00:05). Logs:
`~/Library/Logs/operon-archive.{log,err}`. After files move into the excluded `Operon/Archives`, Obsidian must
reindex (restart or `operon:rebuild-index`) to drop them from open views.

**Windows/Linux:** no launchd. Schedule the same `python3 operon_daily_archive.py --vault "<VAULT>"` daily via
Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron / systemd-timer (Linux). The script is cross-platform.

## 11. Verification checklist

- [ ] Task Creator makes file-tasks in `Operon/Tasks/` from the template (Описание/Прогресс/Результат), `assignees: [<OWNER>]`.
- [ ] Statuses are `Brainstorming/Planned/InProgress/Finished/Paused/Dropped`, shown in the table **without** the `Project.` prefix.
- [ ] The table has a `project` column; the `project` field is available in Creator/Editor.
- [ ] `Dashboard.md` shows the table (OWNER's tasks only) + a working button row.
- [ ] An external github/arxiv/… link renders as a logo badge in Reading view.
- [ ] (If patched) `taskIcon: 🤖` renders as emoji in the table.
- [ ] (macOS) `operon_daily_archive.py --vault "<VAULT>" --dry-run` runs without error.

## 12. Maintenance

- **After every Operon update**: re-run `operon_patches.py "<VAULT>"` — updates overwrite `main.js`.
  `data.json` settings/presets/fields survive updates.
- **New active project**: create `Operon/Projects/[PROJECT] <name>.md` (a file-task with `operonId`); tag its
  tasks `project: [<name>]`. Do not use `parentTask`.
- **New collaborator** (for assignee suggestions): create `people/<name>.md` with frontmatter `имя:` (or `name:`).
- **Change archive timing**: edit `StartCalendarInterval` in the plist, then `launchctl unload/load`.
- **Backups**: `operon_configure.py` writes `data.json.bak-*`; `operon_patches.py` writes `main.js.prepatch`.
