# Obsidian Experiment Log

Use this skill whenever project work changes the experimental state — either because a new run is being designed, launched, monitored, or completed, or because results need to be promoted into stable findings.

## Role in the workflow

Supporting skill under `obsidian-project-memory`. Covers two layers:
1. **Operations** — how to launch, monitor, and chain real training runs on remote servers
2. **Notes** — how to record the run's intent, progress, finals, and decisions into Obsidian

Both layers must be applied together. A finished experiment with no notes is invisible to future agents; a beautifully written note with no actual run is fiction.

---

## Layer 1 — Operations (running the experiments)

### Two execution modes — pick by user intent

| Mode | When to use | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Live monitor with /loop** | Multi-hour runs needing post-finish actions (kill tmux, refresh plot, launch next from queue, write final into table). User says "следи / поставь N ранов / запусти когда освободится". | [[general/Knowledge/autonomous-experiment-loop]] |
| **Push queue (per-GPU lane)** | Set-and-forget N items, no trigger logic, no chained actions. User says "поставь очередь на ночь". | [[general/Knowledge/server-run-queue]] |

The live-monitor mode is the default for warmup-style hypothesis studies. The push queue is for compute-burning ablations where order matters but events don't.

### Launch primitive (tmux + pipe-pane)

Every training run = one tmux session whose pane is piped to a log file. Survives ssh drop, log stays parseable.

```bash
ssh SERVER "tmux new-session -d -s SESSION_NAME && \
  tmux pipe-pane -t SESSION_NAME:0 'cat >> /abs/path/logs/RUN.txt' && \
  tmux send-keys -t SESSION_NAME 'source ~/venv/bin/activate' Enter && sleep 1 && \
  tmux send-keys -t SESSION_NAME 'cd ~/repo' Enter && \
  tmux send-keys -t SESSION_NAME 'GPU=N WS=X LR=Y SEED=Z bash scripts/param_run.sh' Enter"
```

Critical ordering:
- `tmux new-session -d -s NAME` first, **then** `pipe-pane`, **then** `send-keys`. Collapsing them (`tmux new -d -s NAME 'cmd'`) races the pane setup → empty log.
- Verify within 60–90 s: `tmux capture-pane -t NAME:0 -p | tail -10` should show `Iter=` lines. If only optimizer-init lines after 60 s, the run is stuck — kill and investigate before scheduling the next tick.

### Parametrized launcher (one script per experiment family)

Don't write one bash script per run. One parametrized script per family, env-var-controlled:

```bash
ITERS=${ITERS:-32000}
GPU=${GPU:-0}
LR=${LR:-1e-3}
WS=${WS:-10}
SEED=${SEED:-0}
# ... --lr $LR --warmup_steps $WS --seed $SEED ...
```

Adding `SEED=42` for reproducibility reruns becomes a one-line edit (`SEED=${SEED:-0}` + `--seed $SEED`). No fork. Default unchanged so prior runs unaffected.

### The /loop prompt (state lives in the prompt, not the agent)

```
AUTONOMOUS <study> on <server>.

CURRENT active runs (N):
- `session_1` (GPU X, ~Ys/iter, last iter, last val)

DONE so far: <seed=0 finals>

PLANNED queue: <ordered list of configs>

GPU plan: <which finish → which launch>

Each tick: ssh SERVER 'grep ">Eval" logs/<files>; nvidia-smi'

TRIGGERS:
(a) GPU >50GB free AND <30% util AND next item not running → launch
(b) running session hits target iter → record final, kill tmux, refresh plot, launch next
(c) ALL queue done → write final results section, STOP loop

Launch template: <one-line tmux+pipe-pane command>

CONSTRAINTS: paper-canonical hypers only. 30-min cadence. NO other launches.
```

The agent re-receives this verbatim every 30 min via `ScheduleWakeup(1800, /loop ...)`. Nothing in the model's head; state lives entirely in server logs + the prompt itself.

### Trigger semantics

| Trigger | Action | Don't forget |
|---|---|---|
| `last_eval_iter == target_iter` | record final, `tmux kill-session -t NAME`, refresh plot | check pane shows `wandb` sync + shell prompt — confirms clean exit, not OOM |
| GPU `>50GB free AND <30% util` | launch next queued config | re-check 60 s after launch that `Iter=` appears in log |
| **Same iter for two consecutive ticks** | **investigate stall before next tick** | check pane (`tmux capture-pane`) for traceback; check `df -h /data` for disk-full |
| All queue items finished | write final summary section + STOP loop (no ScheduleWakeup) | refresh plot one last time, add MemPalace drawer |

### GPU contention on shared servers

Other users grab freed GPUs in seconds. Two rules:

1. **Don't assume the GPU you freed is the GPU you'll reclaim.** After `kill-session`, log GPU map immediately. If now-owned by someone else, find a different free GPU.
2. **Safe envelope on H200 (141GB):** `>50GB free AND <30% util` for ~24GB models. Tighten or loosen per server class.

```bash
# GPU state
ssh SERVER 'nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,memory.used,memory.free,utilization.gpu --format=csv,noheader'

# Ownership (who runs what)
ssh SERVER 'nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=gpu_uuid,pid,used_memory,process_name --format=csv,noheader'
```

Map UUID → index using `--query-gpu=index,gpu_uuid`.

### Two failure modes to design for

**Same iter as last tick — process is stuck or dead.** Don't blindly schedule another tick. Capture the pane (`tmux capture-pane -t NAME:0 -p | tail -20`), look for: Python traceback, wandb upload + shell prompt (= clean finish you didn't notice), or silence (= true hang).

**Disk full mid-checkpoint.** `torch.save` fails partial writes with `RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:...] . unexpected pos N vs 0`. Check `df -h /data`. If >95% full, **do not restart** — it will crash again. Accept partial result, document, move on.

### Brutal honest reporting

If a run crashed, write "crashed at iter X with traceback Y", not "may not have completed". If a finding rests on a partial trajectory, say so explicitly — "Q3 didn't finish; trajectory at 84% (val 3.072) consistent with Q1 at same %; inferred final ~3.04". Reviewers see through hedge-words; agents shouldn't generate them.

### Constraints worth always restating in the /loop prompt

- Paper-canonical hyperparameters only (no off-paper "fixes" without explicit user approval)
- NO other launches without explicit user instruction
- Cadence 30 min (1800 s): under 5 min wastes prompt-cache, over 60 min misses contention windows

---

## Layer 2 — Notes (documenting the experiments)

### Default outputs

- the relevant canonical note in `Experiments/`
- the relevant canonical note in `Results/`, if a durable finding exists
- links from today's `Daily/` note
- relevant hub or plan references only when project state materially changes

### Main rules

- Prefer updating an existing experiment note over creating a sibling note for the same experiment line.
- Prefer updating an existing result note over creating a parallel result page for the same durable finding.
- Raw logs, metric dumps, and temporary analysis fragments stay in `Daily/` until interpreted.
- A result note should exist only when the outcome is stable enough to reference later.

### File roles — three files, three jobs

| File | Role | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `Experiments/<series>.md` | per-tick narrative: launches, mid-run progress, decisions, crashes | every meaningful tick / finish |
| `Results/<series>-table.md` | only finals, only paper-grade. Sectioned by hypothesis. Embeds plot PNG. | when a final lands |
| `tools/refresh_plot.sh` (project-side) | local script: rsyncs remote logs, calls plot script, swaps PNG path in Results md | each tick that materially changes plotted data |

The Experiments log is the **narrative**; the Results table is the **conclusion**. Don't mix.

### Minimum experiment sections

- Goal / hypothesis
- Code or config entrypoint
- Dataset / split
- Metrics
- Status (`planned`, `running`, `done`, `failed`)
- Findings / notes
- Next step

### Minimum result sections

- Linked experiment
- Main observation
- Key numbers
- Evidence (loss curve, table, plot embed)
- Interpretation
- Decision: keep / iterate / discard

### Linking rule

Link experiments and results directly to each other, and link both back to `00-Hub.md`, `01-Plan.md`, or `Daily/` only when those references improve the main working surface.

### Research path handoff

Treat experiment notes as the bridge between `Papers/` and `Results/`:
- paper-derived hypotheses, baselines, and ablations land here
- stable findings get promoted from here into `Results/`
- when a result becomes claim-worthy, update `Writing/` rather than leaving the chain unfinished

### Post-mortem ritual (after every meaningful event)

1. Append to `Experiments/<series>.md` with timestamp + brief reads
2. If a result (val_loss, perplexity, accuracy): write the number into `Results/<series>-table.md` and refresh plot
3. If a decision (restart? give up? accept partial?): write 2–3 lines of reasoning in Experiments
4. After 5–10 such events: `mempalace_add_drawer` summarizing what's stable knowledge now

## Skill activation

Trigger this skill on user phrases like:
- "запусти параллельно X, Y, Z и следи"
- "поставь раны на N часов и сделай Q когда добежит"
- "сделай seed reruns после того как закончится текущий sweep"
- "проверь как идёт <experiment>" / "как там дела"
- "запиши результаты эксперимента в таблицу"
- "у меня крашнулся ран — что делать"

Workflow when activated:
1. Identify mode (live-monitor vs push-queue) from user intent
2. Identify project paths (`Experiments/<series>.md`, `Results/<series>-table.md`) from project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. For live-monitor: build /loop prompt → launch first runs via tmux+pipe-pane primitive → `ScheduleWakeup(1800s)`
4. For push-queue: follow [[server-run-queue]]
5. On every tick: log to Experiments narrative; on every final: update Results table + refresh plot
6. Stop the loop only after writing the final summary section (no orphaned ScheduleWakeup calls)
