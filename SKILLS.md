# Skills catalog

Detailed reference for every skill shipped in this config (`skills/`). For the mental
model of *what a skill is* and *how progressive disclosure works*, see the seminar
handbook (`docs/seminar/handbook/04-skills.md` in the Obsidian vault).

**How to read this:** a skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md`. Only its one-line
`description` sits in the model's context at all times; the body is loaded on demand
when the description matches the task. So the description's *triggers* decide whether a
skill fires. Each entry below gives **what it does** and **when it fires**.

**Legend:** ⭐ = flagship skill unique to this fork · ◇ = adapted/vendored from upstream
(`claude-scholar`, Anthropic document-skills, `kepano/obsidian-skills`, community). See
[Credits in the README](README.md#credits).

## A. Literature pipeline (arXiv → Zotero → Obsidian)

The core research loop: get a paper into your library with a real, audited note.

- **`paper-ingest`** ⭐ — End-to-end ingestion of a single paper. Give it an arXiv or
  AlphaXiv URL: it fetches BibTeX from an external API (never LLM-generated), downloads
  the PDF, extracts figures/tables from the TeX source, creates a Zotero parent item
  with a PDF child attachment, prevents duplicates, and writes an unusually detailed
  Obsidian note with an 8-section AI Explanation (including Prerequisites) authored by
  Haiku, ending with a strict BibTeX audit. *Fires on:* an arXiv/AlphaXiv link + "ingest this paper".
- **`want-2-read`** ⭐ — Batch version. Processes a `want_2_read.md` reading queue: one
  fan-out agent per paper, each invoking `paper-ingest`, then a final review agent for
  quality control, and rewrites the queue with final wiki-links, Zotero links, and
  descriptions. *Fires on:* "process my reading list / want-2-read".
- **`paper-search`** ⭐ — Library-aware arXiv shortlist. Scans for fresh papers on your
  topics and writes a shortlist into the Obsidian literature inbox, skipping anything
  already ingested. *Fires on:* "scan for new papers on this topic".
- **`zotero-obsidian-bridge`** — Turns papers already in Zotero into detailed reading
  notes inside the bound Obsidian project, checks collection-wide note coverage, and
  builds a connected knowledge map. *Fires on:* "papers are in Zotero, write notes".
- **`obsidian-literature-workflow`** — Filesystem-first literature review when notes
  live inside an Obsidian project KB: agent-first Zotero ingestion, `Papers/` + `Knowledge/`
  synthesis, collection normalization, default literature canvas, no Obsidian MCP needed.
- **`citation-verification`** — Reference guidance (not an action skill): principles and
  common error patterns for verifying citations. Supports `ml-paper-writing`. *Fires on:*
  "how to verify references / citation best practices".
- **`pdf-reader`** ◇ — Extracts structured text from a PDF via PyMuPDF (pypdf fallback).
  *Fires on:* "read this PDF / what's in this PDF" + a path.
- **`kaggle-learner`** ◇ — Access to extracted knowledge from winning Kaggle solutions
  (NLP, CV, time series, tabular, multimodal). *Fires on:* "learn from Kaggle" + a URL.

## B. Paper writing & review

- **`ml-paper-writing`** ⭐ — Write publication-ready ML/AI papers for NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/
  ACL/AAAI/COLM. Drafting from a research repo, literature review, related-work search,
  citation verification, and camera-ready prep. Ships LaTeX templates and citation
  workflows. *Fires on:* "draft a paper / write the related work / camera-ready".
- **`astar-paper-review`** ⭐ — Write a peer review at the standard of a strong reviewer
  at a top venue. Runs a thorough reviewer + a theoretician (appendix/proofs) + a
  literature-scout (related work, uncited papers) + an experiments-auditor (numbers,
  hyperparameter search, released code), extracts your own PDF annotations, surfaces a
  weakness skeleton in chat first, then writes one review file per paper in the
  Summary / Strengths-Weaknesses / Questions / Limitations format. Handles prompt
  injection inside PDFs safely. Venue-agnostic. *Fires on:* "review this paper" or a handed PDF.
- **`review-response`** — Systematic rebuttal workflow: analyze reviewer comments →
  professional response. *Fires on:* "write rebuttal / respond to reviewers".
- **`research-ideation`** — Research startup: brainstorm ideas, 5W1H, gap analysis,
  question definition, method selection, planning. *Fires on:* "brainstorm research
  ideas / gap analysis / start a research project".
- **`latex-conference-template-organizer`** — Turn a messy conference template `.zip`
  into a clean Overleaf-ready structure. *Fires on:* "organize LaTeX template".

## C. Experiments & results

- **`obsidian-experiment-log`** ⭐ — Note structure *and* operational workflow for ML
  runs: design, ablations, baselines, metrics, failures, plus launching/monitoring/
  post-mortem of multi-hour runs on shared servers. *Fires on:* experiment design or
  result-interpretation discussion.
- **`results-analysis`** — Strict statistical analysis + real scientific figures:
  significance, model comparison, ablations. Produces analysis bundles, not prose.
  *Fires on:* "analyze experimental results / check significance".
- **`results-report`** — Turn completed experiment artifacts into a structured,
  decision-oriented report (assumes `results-analysis` ran first). *Fires on:* "write an
  experiment report / retrospection".

## D. Presentation & promotion

- **`presentation`** ⭐ — LaTeX Beamer slides for theory/maths/conference talks. Enforces
  one mathematical chain (each formula motivated by the previous slide), stable notation,
  Russian prose by default, and treats overflow/heavy shrink as errors. Ships a built-in
  **terminal style** (dark, monospace, bright-green accent). *Fires on:* "make slides /
  rewrite this deck / use terminal style".
- **`paper-to-social`** ⭐ — Turn a paper into copy-paste-ready social posts (Telegram,
  Twitter/X, Habr), with figures pulled from the arXiv version, in your own voice (never
  AI-sounding). *Fires on:* "make a post about this paper / promote this paper".

## E. Obsidian knowledge base & project setup

  cards) without creating a filesystem folder. *Fires on:* "new paper / new idea".
- **`create-project`** ⭐ — Full project setup: `~/Papers/<slug>/` with `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  (SSH servers, code paths), private Obsidian hub, `obsidian-projects.json` registration,
  and a handoff to shared onboarding for Brain Lab projects. *Fires on:* "create project / new project".
- **`lab-project-onboarding`** ⭐ — Idempotently create or reuse the Lab Knowledge project,
  generated Yonote showcase, and private named Kanban, then store only stable links in the
  private Obsidian hub. *Fires on:* "add this project to the lab / bind it to Brain Lab".
- **`lab-knowledge`** ⭐ — Run Ask Lab in the local agent: combine permission-scoped research
  context from Lab Knowledge MCP with shared task state from the bound Yonote Kanban, publish
  private Obsidian hypotheses only after explicit confirmation, and keep hypotheses,
  experiments, evidence, decisions, and tasks distinct. *Fires on:* "Ask Lab / has anyone tested this hypothesis / publish this hypothesis".
- **`call-notes`** ⭐ — Turn meeting notes into canonical records: personal actions go to
  the private note, shared project actions to Yonote, and approved research objects to Lab
  Knowledge. It records stable links without task or hypothesis mirrors. *Fires on:* "write up this call / tasks from the call".
- **`code-ingest`** ⭐ — One-time deep analysis of an external repo (GitHub URL or path)
  into a structured set of Obsidian Code-library notes mapping how it works (entrypoint,
  modules, where to change X) — citing `path:line`, never copying code. *Fires on:*
  "add this repo to the code library".
- **`code-library`** ⭐ — Reference for the whole code workflow: which coding skills/rules
  apply, how the Code library works, how a project hub card records its repo and edits,
  how experiments are monitored. *Fires on:* "how do we work with code here" / onboarding

  badges on project pages, emoji task icons, and day-boundary auto-archiving. Applies plugin
  settings (`data.json`), templates, a CSS snippet, optional `main.js` display patches, and an
